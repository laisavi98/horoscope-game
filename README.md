# Horoscope Game 🔮

Welcome! This is a beginner Python project where the user interacts with a fun horoscope generator.

## ✨ About the Project

This is a console-based Python game where the user:
- Is greeted and asked to play
- Can input their zodiac sign
- Receives a fun horoscope message based on their answer
- Practices basic input/output in Python
- Uses `if/else` statements and user interaction

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use `input()` to get user responses
- How to use `if/elif/else` to control program flow
- Writing clear and friendly messages for users
- Structuring a small Python script

## 🗂️ File Included
